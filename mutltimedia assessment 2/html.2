<p style="text-align:right;">Painkiller is a song recorded by Australian singer-songwriter Ruel. The song was released on 1 May 2019 as the lead single from his second extended play, Free Time. The song sees Ruel reunite with producer M-Phazes and Sarah Aarons (whom he had both collaborated with on his 2017 EP Ready), and collaborate with songwriter Hiren Mor for the first time.[2]

In May 2020, a remix featuring American rapper Denzel Curry was released, alongside the announcement of a forthcoming remix EP. The Painkiller remix EP was released on 12 June 2020.[3]

The song placed third at the 2020 Vanda & Young Global Songwriting Competition.</p>
